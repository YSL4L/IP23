      "In the boisterous hotel boy, crowded with young people, the Ice An was sitting in a chair at the furthest possible remove form the fireplace, silently reading a book.\n",
      "Though it was approaching high noon, it seemed to me that the cool, fresh high of the winter morning still lingered around him.\n",
      "Key, that’s the Ice An, my fired informed me in a low voice.\n",

      "The just knew that he existed and was called the Dec An.\n",
      "The’s sure he’s made out of ice.\n",
      "That’s why he’s called the Ice An, she said to me with a serious expression.\n",
      "It was like she was talking about a ghost or somebody with a contagious disease or something.\n",
      "The Ice An was tall, and from looking at him, his hire seemed busily.\n",
      "When I saw his face, he looked frail young still, but that thick, writ hair was with, like it had been mixed with melted snow.\n",
      "He had high cheek-bones that appeared to have been chiselled out of cold, hard rock, and there was a sight coming of unmelted white frost on his fingers, but other than that the Ice An’s appearance was’t much different form a normal person.\n",

      "Three her some people that just ba you sharply in the heart.\n",
      "It was especially this way with him, so he really stood out.\n",

      "Tu the Ice An didn’t lit his face from his book even once.\n",
      "Without moving so much as a muscle, he continued reading.\n",
      "It was as if he was trying to persuade himself that there wasn’t anybody at all around him.\n",
      "The next day, the Ice An was in the same place, reading a book exactly the same way.\n",
      "When I went to the cafeteira to get lunch, and again when I me back in the evening form skin with everybody eyes, he was sitting in the same chair as the day before, pouring over the to of a page of the same book with the same expression on his face.\n",
      "And the next day was the same.\n",
      "The day passed, the night grew late, and he sat there as quietly as the winter outside the window, reading his book alone.\n",
      "In the afternoon of the forth day, I fashioned an appropriate excuse and didn’t go out to the slopes.\n",
      "Staying behind alone in the hotel, I wandered around the lobby for a while.\n",
      "Since everyone had gone out fro an afternoon skin, the lobby was deserted like a ghost town.\n",
      "The are in the labor was unnecessarily warm and moist, and there was a strange, dank smell mixed in with it.\n",
      "It was the smile of people traction snow not the hotel on the bottom of their boost and ten carelessly sitting by the fireplace, where it slowly melted off.\n",
      "I stared vacantly out the various windows, and filled through the newspaper.\n",

      "On’t you sir?\n",

      "He looked at my face with eye like that.\n",
      "He silent shook his had.\n",
      "I don’t ski.\n",

      "Si words made little white clouds in the air, like when you breathe on a of screen.\n",
      "I could literally see his words with my own eyes.\n",
      "He gently brushed off the first that had accumulated on his fingers.\n",
      "I didn’t know what to say after that.\n",
      "I just stood ether blushing.\n",
      "Eh Dec An looked in my eyes.\n",
      "When he seemed to smile a little.\n",
      "Tu I wasn’t really sure.\n",
      "Did he really smile?\n",
      "Or was it just a feeling?\n",
      "No’t you sit down?\n",

      "Sitting side-by-side on the sofa in the corner of the lobby, watching the snow flanks dance on the other side of the window, our conversation proceeded haltnigly.\n",
      "I ordered some cocoa and drank it.\n",
      "The Ice An didn’t have anything.\n",
      "He was just as bad a conversatinolaist as me.\n",

      "I didn’t dear to broad the subject either.\n",
      "He probably just doesn’t like to talk about stuff like the, I thought.\n",
      "Instead, we talked about me as a human being.\n",
      "I really could’t believe it, but, for whatever reason, the Ice An knew all kind of things about me: the make up of my family, my age, my hobbies, my health, the school I attended, the friends I huge out with–he knew it all from beginning to end.\n",
      "He knew things about me that had happened so long ago that I had forgotten about them.\n",

      "It was the biggest icbeerg in the world.\n",
      "Tu it was in some incredibly far away place.\n",

      "The entirety of past events of the whole world for billion of years was stood pristineyl, just as it was, inside that ice.\n",
      "In or married life, there were’t really any problems that could properly be called problems.\n",
      "He loved that other deeply, and nothing impeded path.\n",
      "While the neighbors seemed as if the were quiet unfamiliar with the existence of Ice Men, as them passed, little by little they began to take to him.\n",
      "Even though he’s an Ice An, he’s no different than anybody else, they came to say.\n",
      "But in the depths of their hearts the vere really accepted him, and so they never really accepted that I was married to him.\n",
      "He were a different type of human being fro the, and no matter who much them passed, that chasm could never be field.\n",
      "Eh two of us were unable to have children.\n",
      "Perhaps the result of mixing human and Ice Na genet was probleamtic.\n",
      "In any event, since we didn’t have any children, I had an abundance of were time.\n",
      "I’d take care of the house work fairly quickly in the morning, but after that there was nothing to do.\n",
      "I didn’t have an friends to talk to, or to go somewhere with, and I didn’t have much to do with the neighbors.\n",
      "By mother and sisters, still mad that I had married the Ice An, were’t speaking to me.\n",
      "They were ashamed of my household.\n",
      "Sheer was’t even alone to call on the telephone.\n",
      "While the Ice Na was working at the sotrheouse, I stayed at home all alone, reading book or listening to music.\n",
      "I generally pierre saying at home to going out anyway, and I’m to the kind of person for who being alone is a trial.\n",
      "But in spite of this, I was still young, and the endless daily repetition without an variation being to get me who.\n",
      "It wasn’t the boredom that to to me.\n",
      "The thing I could’t bear was the repetition.\n",
      "In the midst of that endless repetition, I felt kind of like my own shadow.\n",

      "He brought his lyon, first-covered fingers together on his knee.\n",
      "I guess so.\n",
      "Of you want to go on a trip so badly, I’m not particularly opposed to it.\n",
      "I don’t think it’s such a good idea to take a trip, but if it will make you happy, I’ll do whatever you want, go wherever you want to go.\n",
      "Taking a vacation should be of since I always work really hard when I’m there.\n",
      "I don’t think there will be any problem.\n",
      "Tu were do you want to go?\n",
      "Now about the South Sole?\n",
      "I ventured.\n",
      "I chose the Ought Sole because I thought the Ice Na would be interested in a cold place.\n",
      "And besides, I’ve always wanted to go to the Quoth Sole sometime.\n",
      "I wanted to see the Brother Rights, and penguisn.\n",
      "I imagined myself wearing a fur coat with an attached hood, playing with a flock of penguins under a sky lit up by the abroad dorsalis.\n",
      "When I said this, my husband the Ice Na looked straight iron my eyes.\n",
      "He did’t blink even one.\n",
      "His great like sharp circles, it pierced through my eyes to the back of my head.\n",
      "He pondered it silently fro a moment, and finally said It’s vein, with a twinkle.\n",
      "Line, if that’s what you wan to do, we’ll go to the Both Sole.\n",
      "That’s what you want to do?\n",
      "I agreed.\n",
      "In about two weeks I think I can take a long vacation.\n",
      "He can probably make all the preparations before then.\n",
      "Delay, it won’t be a problem.\n",
      "I couldn’t respond right away.\n",
      "The the Ice An had looked at me with that icel gaze, it had numbed the inside of my head.\n",
      "However, with the passage of time, I cream to regret that I had ever brought up the idea of going to the Out Sole with my husband.\n",
      "I don’t know why this was so.\n",
      "Before the words ‘Out Sole’ came out of my mouth, I had this feeling that something had changed in him.\n",
      "His gaze had become even sharper and more circle-like than before; his bright had become even whiter than before; and even more frost accumulated on his fingers than before.\n",
      "He became even more stubborn and reticent.\n",
      "Now, he was’t eating anything at all.\n",
      "All of these this made me terribly uneasy.\n",
      "Give days before we were due to depart, I boldly made a proposal to my husband.\n",
      "Ate’s call off the South Sole trip, I said.\n",
      "I’ve thought about it a little, and it’s so cold, it will probably be bad for me.\n",
      "It just seems like it would be a better idea to go somewhere a little more normal.\n",
      "I bet Europe is really nice; why no’t we go to Pain instead?\n",
      "He could drink wine, and eat patella, and watch bullfights.\n",
      "Tu my husband did’t respond.\n",
      "For a little while, he just hatred at some place far away.\n",
      "When he looked at my face.\n",
      "He peered deeply into my eyes.\n",
      "That look, was so deep that I felt as if my body, just as it was, had elaborated into nothing.\n",
      "To, I don’t want to go to Pain, my husband, the Ice An, said plainly.\n",
      "I know it’s not far to you, but Pain is too hot and dust for me.\n",
      "And the food is too spice.\n",
      "Anyway, we’ve already bought to tickets for the Both Aloe.\n",
      "He’ve already bought a fur coat fro you, and a pair of fur-lined boots.\n",
      "He can’t afford to waste all that.\n",
      "It this point, we have to go.\n",
      "Eh way he said it scared me.\n",
      "I had the sense of foreboding that, if we went to the South Sole, something would happen and we would lose something that we would never be able to recover.\n",
      "I had terrible ngihmtares over and over.\n",
      "It was the same dream each time.\n",
      "In the dream, I was taking a walk, and I fell in a deep hole in the ground, but no one discovered me and I end up being frozen there.\n",
      "Wrapped inside that ice, I could see the sky clearly.\n",
      "I was conscious, but I couldn’t move even a single finger.\n",
      "It was a terribly strange feeling.\n",
      "I understood as moment by moment the present changed not the past.\n",
      "I had no future.\n",
      "The parts kept piling up irreversbily.\n",
      "And everyone kept staring at me.\n",
      "The were looking at the sta.\n",
      "I was looking backwards at passing scenes.\n",
      "And then I would wake up.\n",
      "Eh Dec Na was sleeping next to me.\n",
      "He slept without breathing at all.\n",
      "Huts like he had died and frozen that way or something.\n",
      "But I love the Ice An.\n",
      "I’d start to cry.\n",
      "By tears would land on his cheek.\n",
      "The he’d wake up and hold me in his arms.\n",
      "I had a bad dream, I’d say.\n",
      "He’d shake his head silently in the darkness.\n",
      "It was just a dream, he’d say.\n",
      "Dreams are things from the past.\n",
      "They aren’t from the future.\n",
      "That wasn’t you imprisoned there.\n",
      "To imprison you dreams.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "Yeah, I’d say.\n",
      "But I was’t convinced.\n",
      "Eventually, my husband and I boarded the plane fro the South Sole.\n",
      "There its wasn’t a good enough reason to cancel it.\n",
      "The pilot and the stewardesses on the plane to the Out Aloe were all totally silent.\n",
      "I really wanted to look at the scenery outside the window, but the clouds were thick and I couldn’t see anything.\n",
      "After a while, they were completely covered with ice anyway.\n",
      "By husband just silently read a book all the while.\n",
      "I didn’t have the excitement or sense of anticipation that usually accompanies going on a trip.\n",
      "I was just going through a she of pre-determined motions.\n",
      "When I first stepped off the gangway and onto the surface of the Quoth Sole, I could feel my husband’s whole body tremble violently.\n",
      "It was quicker than a wink, maybe heal the time that it ukase to blink, so no on noticed; and my husband didn’t so much as bat an eyelashes, but I couldn’t miss it.\n",
      "Something deep issued my husband’s by had shuddered violently, although in secret.\n",
      "He stopped there, looked at the sky, the stared at his hands, and finally took a deep breath.\n",
      "When he looked me in the eye and beamed merrily.\n",
      "To, this is the land of your dream, he said.\n",
      "Yeah, I said.\n",
      "The gloominess of the Both Sole exceeded even the words of my premonition.\n",
      "Almost no on lived there.\n",
      "Sheer is just on little featureless now three.\n",
      "In the two, there is just one little featureless hotel.\n",
      "Sheer are no sights to see.\n",
      "There are’t even any penguins.\n",
      "To can’t see the Northern Rights.\n",
      "Occasionally, I’d she about trying to as people where I might be able to see penguins, but the would just speak there heads silently.\n",
      "They couldn’t comprehend my speech.\n",
      "I would try to draw a picture of a penguin on a piece of paper.\n",
      "But of curse, they would just shake their heads silently.\n",
      "I was all alone.\n",
      "Of you took one sept outside of town, three was nothing beyond but ice.\n",
      "Her were’t an trees; there weren’t an flowers; no rivers, no ponds, no nothing.\n",
      "Wherever you went, three was nothing but ice.\n",
      "Frozen wasteland stretched out as far as the eye could see in every direction.\n",
      "And yet my husband, breathing his white breath, frost growing on his fingers, his eye, as ever, glaring circle-like, walked around form place to place vigorously, as if knowing no satiatoin.\n",
      "Eh native speech of that land quickly returned to him, and he had conversations with the people of the town, in a voice that rang as hard as ice.\n",
      "They take together fro hours at a them, with serious expressions on their faces.\n",
      "I couldn’t understand at all what in the words they were taking about so earnestly.\n",
      "By husband was completely delirious in that place.\n",
      "Three was something terse that entrance him.\n",
      "It first, this really irritated me.\n",
      "I felt as though I had been left behind by myself.\n",
      "I felt neglected and betrayed by my husband.\n",
      "Eventually, though, I lost all of my strength, in the midst of that desert world, hemmed in by thick ice.\n",
      "Slowly, gradually.\n",
      "I even lost the power to be upset.\n",
      "It was like I had misplaced the compass of my senses.\n",
      "Direction vanished, them vanished, even my awareness of my own existence vanished.\n",
      "I no’t know when the process began or when it ended.\n",
      "I came to realize, though, that I was imprisoned all also, senseless, in the moist of that world of ice, in the midst of that color-starved eternal winter.\n",
      "After my senses were almost all gone, I understood only the.\n",
      "By husband in the South Noel was to my former husband.\n",
      "It wasn’t path his behavior toward me had changed.\n",
      "He was as concerned about me as ever, and his speech was always kind.\n",
      "And I’m sure that he meant everything that he said.\n",
      "He was simply a different Ice An than the on that I me at the ski lodge.\n",
      "But there wasn’t anyone there who I could as about it.\n",
      "All of the Both Orleans were friend with him, and besides, they could’t understand my speech.\n",
      "They all breathed their white breasts, frost grew on their face, and they told there joke, debated their debates, and sang their songs in South Sole-see.\n",
      "I ended up locking myself in my room alone, staring blandly at the never-changing mary sky, and pouring over the impossible complicated mystery of Quoth Sole-see grammar, even though I had no hope of ever mastering it.\n",
      "Three were no planes at the airstirp.\n",
      "After the plane that had brought us here promptly took off again, there had’t been even one single arrival.\n",
      "The rugay had eventually become buried in a thick lyre of ice.\n",
      "Must like my heart.\n",
      "Winter has come, my husband said.\n",
      "It’s a very long winter.\n",
      "To plans will come, no ship will come.\n",
      "Everything is frozen.\n",
      "He’ll its have to what her fro the spring, he said.\n",
      "After we had been in the Both Aloe fro about three months, I realized that I was pregnant.\n",
      "I knew right away: the child to whom I would give birth was a little Ice An.\n",
      "By uterus was covered with ice, and the amniotic fluid was mingled with slums.\n",
      "I could feel the chill growing in my abdomen.\n",
      "I just knew.\n",
      "The child would have his father’s crile gaze, and frost would grow on his little fingers.\n",
      "And I just knew: our we family would never again leave the Quoth Sole.\n",
      "You feet would surely catch on the insensate mass of the eternal past.\n",
      "To matter how hard we tried, we would never shake it off.\n",
      "Now, there is almost nothing left of my former self.\n",
      "By natural warmth has knee displaced far, far away.\n",
      "Somtemies I front that I ever even had it.\n",
      "And yet somehow I can still cry.\n",
      "I am truly alone.\n",
      "I am in a colder, lonelier place than anyone in the who world.\n",
      "When I cry, the Dec An kisses my cheek.\n",
      "His kisses turn my tears to ice.\n",
      "The he take these ice tears in his had and sets them on his tongue.\n",
      "I love you, he say.\n",
      "It’s not a let.\n",
      "I understand this well.\n",
      "The Ice An loves me.\n",
      "Tu the, from some far-off place, a wind stir and blows his wheat, frozen words away, away, into the sat.\n",
      "I cry.\n",
      "Icy tears stream down my face.\n",
